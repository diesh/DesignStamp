            <h3>Workshops for Tech &amp; Product teams</h3>
            <p><strong>Unlock Your Team’s Potential</strong><br>
              These workshops help teams think bigger, move faster, and collaborate better. They build creativity,
              trust, and momentum through tools your team can use right away.

              <p><strong>What to Expect</strong><br>
                Every session is customized to your team’s goals and challenges. Whether you’re aligning strategy,
                solving complex problems, or reigniting a stalled team, you’ll leave with clarity, alignment, and energy
                to move forward.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Popular Workshops</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Thinking for Leaders:</strong> Use design methods to frame sharper questions, uncover
                  insights, and drive innovation at the leadership level.</li>
                <li><strong>Building an Innovative Culture:</strong> Turn design values into daily habits. Build rituals
                  that keep creativity and customers at the center.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Ideation Sprint:</strong> Cut through noise and surface strong ideas fast. Great for
                  cross-functional or startup teams that need a spark.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Sprint:</strong> Move from messy problem to tested prototype in 4–5 days, backed by
                  customer feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarity &amp; Alignment Workshop:</strong> Align product, design, and leadership around what
                  truly matters before investing time or code.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Who It’s For</strong><br>
                Executives, senior leaders, startups, and cross-functional teams ready to turn meetings into momentum.

            <h3>Coaching for Leaders</h3>
            <p><strong>Leading by Design</strong><br>
              Understand your leadership style, how you show up in calm and high-pressure moments, and how to lead with
              empathy, clarity, and impact.
            </p>

            <div class="extra">
              <p>Learn to rally your team, handle challenges with confidence, and bring out the best in others and
                yourself. This program builds the awareness and habits to lead with intention and resilience.</p>
              <p>Across eight weeks, we’ll strengthen your leadership through reflection, action, and feedback. You’ll
                have weekly 1:1 sessions, focused exercises, and practical tools that create visible progress from the
                start.</p>

              <h4>What You’ll Gain</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Understand the principles and defaults that shape how you lead.</li>
                <li>Clarify what sets you apart and where you want to grow.</li>
                <li>Lead with calm and focus when others are uncertain.</li>
                <li>Influence through trust, not control.</li>
                <li>Build a team that’s honest, respectful, and motivated.</li>
                <li>Design the conditions for great work, then step back.</li>
                <li>Communicate what you believe, how you lead, and what comes next.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Lead What’s Next</h4>
              <p>By the end, you’ll have sharper thinking, stronger presence, and a clearer sense of direction. You’ll
                manage relationships across your organization with confidence and ease.</p>

              <p>Leadership is a lifelong craft. The best leaders keep learning, adapting, and refining. As you apply
                these practices, you’ll gain clarity, confidence, and lasting impact in your work.</p>

              <p>Solid Lives is a global discipleship organization led by Jerry Dirmann, supporting churches and small
                groups around the world through structured study programs. The organization launched <b>the Jesus
                  Disciple App</b> to help group leaders and members access lessons, track progress, and build community
                online.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Despite strong early adoption, app engagement declined sharply over the first year. Group leaders
              struggled to onboard new users, and attendees often reverted to offline study formats. Solid Lives
              partnered with DesignStamp to understand why, and how to bring digital discipleship to life again.</p>
            <p>Over a four-week research sprint, we conducted in-depth interviews with leaders, attendees, and parents
              across three continents. Our goal: uncover what users valued, what frustrated them, and what kept them
              from returning. The insights helped Solid Lives refocus the app’s strategy on usability, motivation, and
              community connection.</p>
            <p>The client agreed to remedy ALL the issues we uncovered in our research and usability audit.</p>

          <div class="leading">
            <p>The Real Estate Council of British Columbia is a regulatory agency established by the provincial
              government in 1958. Its mandate is to protect the public interest by enforcing the licensing and licensee
              conduct requirements of the Real Estate Services Act.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>We have worked with RECBC on several projects, helping them leverage the digital medium to connect in new
            ways with real estate professionals and consumers. Most recently, we have worked with RECBC to help educate
            licensees about the changes to agency rules and disclosure requirements and provide tools to allow licensees
            to comply with new consumer protection rules. You can also read more about our work for RECBC building a <a
              href="recbc-kb.html">knowledge base</a> for real estate professionals.
          </p>
          <p>Licensees spend a lot of time out of their office and often meet consumers at their listing locations. We
            worked with the Council to understand licensee needs and situations such as busy open houses. We wanted to
            find a way to help licensees where they were and have them be able to comply with consumer protection rules
            while saving time. To address these needs, we built a custom app for mobile devices that provides a safe,
            secure way for licensees and consumers to review and sign disclosure forms together. We designed a brief
            how-to video and animated tips to provide licensees with a quick walkthrough to set up and use the app.
            Features such as pre-filled licensee’s information and digital signature collection allows the experience to
            be streamlined. As well, the app automatically delivers copies of the signed forms to all required parties -
            licensees, their brokerages and consumers, with one tap. Licensees can also use the app even if they are
            offline. The app is designed to help consumers understand the licensee/client relationship while protecting
            their personal information.

          <p>BlueShore Financial came to us with the project of helping them better understand the needs and goals of
            their members. As with most credit unions, they compete with the larger banks and need to continually adapt
            to the changing needs of their members. The credit union is proud of its local roots and wanted to offer
            unmatched personalized service that met the needs of its changing member profile.
          </p>
          <p>We scoured the data provided, interviewed key stakeholders in the organization and also conducted
            independent research to learn more about BlueShore Financial's core members. We then segmented the
            population based on key attributes that would define each group's unique needs from their financial
            institution.
          </p>
          <p>Our work became part of the training program for all front-line staff. We also worked with BlueShore to
            help them define and build out their service offerings for their small business unit, serving the needs for
            this unique target audience group. The credit union went on to conduct an extensive rebrand and their
            commitment to offer a differentiated, boutique experience resulted in them creating a unique <em>Financial
              Spa ®</em> branch environment.

          <p>We worked with PEPFAR for two years, bringing HIV/AIDS related aide data online and providing increased
            data transparency as part of an ongoing initiative of the Ambassador Deborah Birx. Our first release of the
            data dashboards was met with praise and its successful adoption lead to the desire to provide more data
            access.<br />
          </p>
          <p>To achieve the goal to provide unprecedented data access meant we needed to re-think navigation and provide
            people with ways to delve deeper into the numbers to understand the work being done in countries around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>The new dashboards provide data access down to a district level, and provide side-by-side comparison views
            across data points. Users are provided multiple ways to interact with the dashboards using map views,
            drop-down menus and rich, interactive charts to explore data

          requirements gathering and designing an application that would meet user needs while also complying to complex
          data rules. DesignStamp was a pleasure to work with, methodical in their ability to conduct user interviews
          with professors, students and aid recipient organizations around the world. Also I appreciated their skills in
          diplomatically working with international stakeholders, extracting objective business requirements and helping
          drive project vision. Their interaction and visual design skills helped us deliver a project that has been
          immensely successful. I would highly recommend DesignStamp as a partner in any interactive project and hope to
          work with them again in the future.

            CanWaCH website helps them engage their members and to showcase the impact of CanWaCH, its members and

        <h1>About DesignStamp</h1>
        <p class="subhead">Human-centered Design Leadership and product clarity since 2001.</p>

        <p>
          I'm <a href="https://diesh.ca?designstamp" target="_blank">Gagan Diesh</a>. I founded DesignStamp in 2001 to
          help organizations build products that matter.
          The world has changed dramatically since we started and so have the challenges. Today, the need for clear,
          mission-driven digital experiences is more urgent than ever. Our work sits at the intersection of design
          leadership
          coaching, product strategy, and research-driven decision-making.
        </p>

        <p>
          Across tech, nonprofit, and finance, we support leaders and teams who want to move faster, make better
          decisions,
          and create digital experiences that matter.
        </p>

        <h2>Today we focus on</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Coaching for product, design, and tech leaders</strong> — helping individuals and teams maximize
            their impact</li>
          <li><strong>Strategic design leadership</strong> — augmenting internal teams with crisp research, design, and
            product clarity</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We continue to support long-term partners while selectively taking on new engagements where we can provide
          momentum and impactful design thinking.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Principles</h2>

        <h3>We respect our clients</h3>
        <p>
          We listen closely, learn deeply, and partner with clients to understand their goals. We ensure our work aligns
          with what matters most to them and demonstrate domain expertise they can rely on. Success is measured by the
          outcomes that matter to their business.
        </p>

        <h3>We respect our work</h3>
        <p>
          We hold ourselves to a high bar. We share our process, speak plainly, and stand behind the integrity of what
          we create.
          We believe great design is collaborative, intentional, and clear.
        </p>

        <h3>We respect ourselves</h3>
        <p>
          We value diverse perspectives and integrate seamlessly with internal teams. Whether we’re coaching leaders or
          supporting
          teams directly, we’re here to help each other do our best work. ❤️
        </p>

        <h2>Our Process</h2>

        <h4><span class="step-num">1.</span>Understand your context</h4>
        <p>
          We begin by learning your team’s goals, constraints, culture, and the decisions in front of you. This gives us
          the clarity
          needed to support you effectively.
        </p>

        <h4><span class="step-num">2.</span>Align on the real problem</h4>
        <p>
          We surface assumptions, map the issues, and confirm what success looks like. This alignment prevents wasted
          effort and
          establishes a shared direction.
        </p>

        <h4><span class="step-num">3.</span> Design the right engagement</h4>
        <p>
          Based on your needs, we may provide fractional design leadership, embedded product and UX support, individual
          coaching,
          or structured design thinking workshops. Every approach is tailored and intentionally scoped.
        </p>

        <h4><span class="step-num">4.</span> Build momentum quickly</h4>
        <p>
          We work in short, focused cycles with clear communication, practical deliverables, and visible progress. You
          get insight,
          alignment, and decisions that move your team forward.
        </p>

        <h4><span class="step-num">5.</span> Strengthen long-term capability</h4>
        <p>
          Our goal is not dependency. We leave teams and leaders with clearer processes, stronger decision-making
          habits, and the
          confidence to move independently.
        </p>
